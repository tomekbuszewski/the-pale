          "Focal Stellia headphones are basically the pinnacle of music listening. Perfect in every detail, from form (I can wear them even during the Summer for hours without discomfort) to factor. I would like to also have Focal Utopias, but given the noise outside my apartment, open-back headphones sadly aren't an option.",
          "Cayin iHA-6 paired with Cayin iDAC6-MK2 are my headphones amplifier and digital-analogue converter. I've switched from JDS Atom and Topping D10 and it's night and day.",
          "Apple Music offers lossless, vast library. Simple as that. I've used Qobuz earlier, which had this hand-curated feel, but too much music was missing. I mean, Apple Music even has obscure Australian industrial from the 80s (warning: early industrial is a hole you might emerge after ten years) or an early Young Guv EP. Come on!"

          "Xbox Series X is something I got due to sheer \"I collect these\" feeling. After 360 I feel that Microsoft really lost the ball. Buying studios and whipping mediocre games (looking at you, latest Forza) doesn't really help here.",
          "Nintendo Switch is a special thing. Its hardware is basically Wii U, which was too little even then it launched, but the games. Oh, the games. Mario Kart 8 is enough to recommend the entire thing, with Metroid Dread, the two Zeldas and other Mario titles to boot.",
          "PC with RTX 3080Ti and Ryzen 7 is my main gaming platform as of recent. I was against gaming on PC for years, mostly due to \"I work with computers, so I don't want them on my free time\", but the games not available on consoles are just too much to ignore. From indies, to oldies (I actually bought the rig to play classic Fallout games), to titles better adjusted for mouse (shooters, RPGs, aRPGs). Fun fact: the first game I launched on my new computer was Quake II, which I wanted to play for over 15 years.",
          "Beelink SER5 is a tiny computer I use as an emulation and media station. My old LG OLED TV doesn't work well with streaming apps, some (like Canal+) don't have dedicated apps at all, so using this is a perfect solution. Plus, since I don't have my PS1 with me, I can still play the games (and some PS2 titles as well, but not as many)."
