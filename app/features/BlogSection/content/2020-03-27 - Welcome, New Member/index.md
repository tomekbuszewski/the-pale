In IT, it is very common to have new team members. And yet, welcoming them is
hardly something we’re good at.

## Before they even come

There is a checklist I like to have _before_ the new person will come. Simple
points that make sure they feel good.

- make sure their desk and chair is there and is clean (yes, I have cleaned a
  desk for someone, nothing wrong with it);
- make sure their hardware is there, is working and set up properly;
- make sure your team mates know that they are coming;
- make sure all the accounts and accesses are granted (if this is impossible due
  to some restrictions, make them know beforehand);
- make sure the access card is ready (this is important, it’s like you’re having
  a new family member but „you don’t get the keys yet”);
- designate a buddy (more on that later);
- prepare an issue (also, more on that later).

When I know that someone will come, let’s say, on Monday, I make sure to have
this day clean of all meetings that are unnecessary.

## Do a tour, thorough one

New environment is always stressful. For almost everyone. So make sure you make
a tour across the office.

**Don’t run across the entire floor asking to shake hands**. Come on, how many
pairs of name/face can you store in your head in one minute? **Try doing it in
batches**, first meet the closest team mates, then spin away with other
departments. Maybe even split this into more days, 30 minutes each, if your
company is big.

**Don’t show kitchen, toilets etc. when returning from somewhere**. **Go from
your room**, it will be easier to memorize the route this way.

**Show where are cups and mugs are** and how to use coffee machine. This is also
a good moment to take a breather and drink something and have some small-talk.

**Show where are office supplies**. Something as trivial as getting a pen
without the necessity to ask people about it will really boost your new team
mate adoption.

## Don’t let them go alone

Sitting people in front of their desks and walking away on the first day is the
worst thing you can do. I got this treatment more than once, „here’s your seat
and desk, settle in” and he walks away. What the fuck I am supposed to do? Where
is… anything?

Instead, sit with them. Ask, do they need some time to set up their computer, or
would they like you to tell them, what they’ll be needing.

If they’ll say they need some time alone, no problem, but don’t forget about
them. Be back in an hour or two, just see how it’s going. Don’t hover, don’t be
a helicopter. Just pop in, „you okay there, need anything” and that’s it.

## Spend time with them

After the workstation is set up, there is time to set up the actual project.
**Don’t send the wiki link and be off**. Such documents are often

- outdated;
- too long;
- too technical;
- assuming that whoever reads them have some domain knowledge.

This is something I call a **dick move**. _But what if I don’t remember the
process_, you may ask. Well, that’s okay, open that goddamn Confluence and go
through it **together**. Or even better, get someone who might know, and work
together. This will also help the new one meet other members. Just make sure you
don’t call in someone who’s harsh.

After that, make sure that someone will sit next to that person. Maybe you,
maybe someone you designate to do this. **Make sure this is a knowledgeable,
communicative person**. No point in sitting a guy with headphones from 9 to 5.
This is often called a **buddy system**.

### How to prep a buddy

Asking „who want’s to be a buddy for Anon here” is a bad move. There won’t be
„me, me!” people yelling. There will be silence, and someone with a sense of
responsibility will come forward only to regret it afterwards.

Instead, pick someone you know in your team **early**. This doesn’t have to be
the best developer. It has to be the most communicative, friendly person. A few
days before the new person arrives, get that someone on a one-on-one and ask,
„could you be a buddy for Anon?” If you are a good lead, they won’t be afraid to
say „no”, if they can justify it. If they’ll refuse, try the next person. Don’t
push it. Forcing people into such interactions never goes well.

But let’s assume they are fine with it. So, what does a buddy do? Buddy simply
is there for this person. Buddy is a go-to, when something breaks, something is
not clear, something needs clarification.

And, once again, **you can be that buddy**, if you decide so.

## Don’t let their questions go unanswered (or answered vaguely)

New people in the organization will have questions. They can be like a kid,
asking all the time. **And this is totally fine**. It’s a sign they really are
interested in this place. Make sure you answer them, and answer thoroughly.
Sure, there’s no need to dive deep in the technical aspects on the first day,
because they’ll won’t digest it all. But don’t answer with „we’ll get to that
later” or „you don’t need this right now”. Even if they really don’t need it,
there’s no harm in telling it.

## Get them to lunch

„Hey, what time do you eat?” is a great question to ask during the day. „You
want to grab something?” On the first day, there is so much going on, people may
either forget, or be too shy to walk away from their station for lunch. Make
sure that this is not the case. You can go together or in larger group, but make
sure you don’t scare the new person. You can feel if this is someone comfortable
with a crowd or not. Don’t try to „break their comfort zone”, you’re not a
dickheaded coach.

## Treat them as part of the team from day one

Great things may happen, if you treat new people like the old ones. Like they
have always been here. Let’s say you team goes for lunch every day at the same
time. Take them with you. You have a problem with your code, ask them, maybe
they’ll help. Even if not, they will feel validated and needed. Look for such
opportunities. Even the slightest gesture may prove beneficial.

## Try having day-one commit

Nothing says „we need you, mate” more than allowing them to work right off the
bat. After they set up, have coffee and lunch, give them a small task. Nothing
fancy, nothing groundbreaking, just something small to stretch their legs. A
small „atom” component, or a tiny test that was missing for a long time.

A lot of people will get something serious to do weeks after the first day. And
this is horrible, both business-wise and company-wise. The former – you are
paying this person. The latter – you will look like lazy slobs.

Caring for new people on board is often neglected. This is wrong and causes
detachment. If you don’t care for me, why should I care for you, Company Name?
