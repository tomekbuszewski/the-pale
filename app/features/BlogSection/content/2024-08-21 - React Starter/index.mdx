I’ve always liked having starter kits for my apps. But ever since Vite came into
the scene, I thought having a React with TypeScript one doesn’t really makes
sense. Turns out, I was wrong.

Looking back at the previous iteration of this starter, dated at late 2019/early
2020, I vividly remember that the hardest and most annoying part there was the
hot reloading. Configuring it with Webpack and TypeScript was really annoying,
and even if I was doing it since 2016 or so, I always struggled. So when I’ve
switched to Vite, I rendered my starter useless.

## The “why”

Recently, as I both started a channel that requires coding examples, and
returned to working with clients, I realized how wrong I was. Installing and
configuring tools I am always using takes a tremendous amounts of time. Even if
I know the code by heart and rarely even consult documentation for Storybook or
Plop, I still have to manually enter most of the things.

My last commission was a React application. I started to install the usual
tools, like Storybook, Plop, Tailwind, configure routing, tests… and I’ve
realized this takes me a lot of time! Why my customers have to pay for me doing
the same (boring, mind you) thing?

That is why, during the past weekend, I’ve decided to put together
[another starter, and make it public](https://github.com/tomekbuszewski/ts-react-starter-v2).
It’s very opinionated, so it most likely won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but
that’s why it is a public repo. You can fork it and make it your own!

## The ”what”

If you’ve seen my video on
[Design Systems Scaffoling](https://buszewski.com/writings/2024-08-13-design-systems-in-react-scaffolding-and-setup-part-0),
you’ll recognize most of the things I’ve put in here. But not without few
surprises.

### Architecture

I’ve decided to go with scalable solutions. Every space in here has its own
directory, which exposes a single `index.tsx` file.

For **UI**, there’s Tailwind and Atomic Design, so atoms, molecules, organisms
and views. Coding the entire view as a prop-augmented solution might be a chore,
but testing it then is very easy and straightforward. But I am first to admit
that sometimes building a page as one file in the pages directory is just
quicker and more productive, given it is small enough.

For **API communication**, I’ve put React Query in. In my experience, 90% of
projects will still utilize REST, so it’s a safer bet. But adding Apollo for
GraphQL is a breeze. Oh, and I’ve configured it to use the root API defined in
`.env`, so whenever you’re doing a fetch, you just need to put the URI, e.g.
`/products` instead of the whole URL.

For **routing**, React Router. I was thinking of going with TanStack Router, but
I’ve went with the popularity here, and given how the former caught up to
Tanner’s solution, I think it sticks. Plus, upcoming transition of Remix might
be a real game changer. But, as with everything here, replacing it is just a
provider away. There’s also `pages` directory, which should be utilized as,
well, pages, and, in `./src/App`, there’s the main routing config.
Unfortunately, React Router doesn’t allow for multiple nested routers, so
sometimes you need to export a feature as a route config, and declare it as
`children` of a page:

```tsx
// ./src/App.tsx

...
{
  path: "/with-fetch",
  element: <ApiPage />,
  children: activities,
},
```

All your pages can be exported either as static imports, or as lazy ones. If you
want to do the former, simply export it from `pages/index.tsx`. If you’d like to
have them lazy-loaded (which I recommend if the page is larger than a few
words), use `pages/lazy.tsx`. In there you can import what you need using the
React’s `lazy`:

```tsx
// ./src/pages/lazy.tsx

import { lazy, Suspense } from "react";

const AnyPage = lazy(() => import("./AnyPage/AnyPage"));
```

And then use the `lazyFactory` function that’ll wrap it in `Suspense`:

```tsx
// ./src/pages/lazy.tsx

export const Any = lazyFactory(AnyPage);
```

It accepts another parameter, if you’d like to have a custom loading component:

```tsx
// ./src/pages/lazy.tsx

import { LoadingBar } from "@ui/molecules";

export const Any = lazyFactory(AnyPage, LoadingBar);
```

For **business features**, I’ve put the `features` directory, in which you
should put all your business-related things, packed in a neat package. There’s
an example that has fetching and routing, but in general, every self-contained
feature should reside there. It can be as small as a cookie popup, or as big as
a sign up flow.

### Testing

Tests are divided into two categories: units/integration and e2e.

For **unit and integration** testing, you should use Vitest. It’s compatible
with Jest (not 100%, which I’ve learn the hard way though), and I’ve added
`@testing-library`’s packages to make sure all React and DOM assertions are
there. All `.test.ts` and `.test.tsx` files will get automatically picked up by
`npm t`;

For **end-to-end**, there’s Playwright. As much as I like Cypress, this looks a
way better alternative. All tests should go to `e2e` directory, but you’re free
to expand this. All of the configuration, including base app url, is kept in
`./playwright.config.ts`. One thing to notice here, is that I’ve added a script
(`npm run test:e2e:mocks`) that will build the app (with mocked server), launch
the localhost, then run the test suites, and, once it’s all done, gracefully
exit.

Oh, yes, **mocks**. I’ve picked MSW, which in my opinion, should be a standard
for mocking any kind of communication. It has its own `mocks` directory, where
you can define new endpoints that’ll be used for both unit and e2e tests. MSW is
bound to run on every unit and integration test, and also can be picked up when
building production app for testing (mentioned `test:e2e:mocks` command), or to
work with a dev mode (`npm run dev:mocks`). What it does is that it intercepts
all traffic coming from the application and if it finds a suitable handler,
instead of letting the traffic further, it takes uses said handler.

### Generators

You might remember Plop, my generator of choice. In here, it’s far more robust,
allowing to generate:

- ui elements;
- hooks;
- utilities;
- pages;
- features.

This way you can forget about copy-pasting all these boring files and just
generate whatever you need and start working right off the bat.

### Linting

First of all, there’s more robust linting using ESLint. It now has more strict
rules, thanks to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked`, but also… import
sorting. This is something I’ve always liked. Having imports grouped in vendors,
internals, types, all this, out of the box (well, out of the… saving file, I
guess) is just comfortable.

### Development and Building

There’s not much changed from the basic Vite config. App builds into a regular
bundle that’ll get split if you're using the lazy imports. Dev mode also works
in a standard way, with hot reloading out of the box.

One thing to notice here is dependency offloading. I am pulling React and
ReactDOM, the largest libraries, from CDN. This is handled by `vite-plugin-cdn2`
plugin, which configuration lies in `./vite.config.ts`.

That’s it. My starter for medium-to-large React apps. I invite you to fork,
create pull requests and issues. It will most certainly live, as I often find
myself adding things to my tooling.
