When building a form – and expecting a user to fill it – the most important
thing is ease of use and recognizability.

Some time ago, in mid 2000s, Internet Explorer 6 and 7 were serious players. And
I mean serious, every product had to be compatible with those guys. The
Microsoft boys were really hustlin’, and every front-end developer knew that.

There was this one thing no `/9` or `!important` couldn’t fix. It was the
`input[radio]` and `input[checkbox]` fields. Styling those was practically
impossible, as they never allowed any tinkering in properties other than border.

Of course, aesthetic-hungry _webmasters_ developed a lot of JavaScript (most of
the time in a form of jQuery plugin) that allowed to style the input however we
wanted. But there were tradeoffs. Hard, often limited, development. Lack of
accessibility. Requiring JavaScript (and back then, it wasn’t so obvious.) So
the forms remained mostly untouched, and it was good.

And then, standardization came. Internet Explorer lost its significance.
Suddenly, styling `input[radio]` wasn’t that impossible. We all used the
_`:before` trick_. It allowed us to do something like this:

Not fancy enough? So, why don’t we break it?

([See it live](https://codepen.io/tomekbuszewski/pen/ExjRRjP?editors=0110).)

You see where I am going with this overlong exposure?

Such examples were very common back then. Round checkboxes and square radios.
But I thought this was all left in the past, where poor interfaces prevailed.

But they are still here.

I got the munchies recently and decided to order a pizza via Internet. There is
one I particularly like, it allows picking own ingredients. So I basically make
the „Greek” pizza I ate when I was a kid. Form, more or less, looks like this:

See the problem? If yes, congratulations, if no, let me play in Sketch some
more:

<figure></figure>

Now you see? All of this items look like `radio` buttons, while in reality,
those are `checkbox` types.

This is not a _design_ choice. No, design is making it more appealing while
keeping the usability intact. This is a mistake. Done perhaps by someone with
less experience in the field, but nevertheless, a mistake. Know better. Don’t
commit such mistakes.

Rounded `input[radio]` and square `input[checkbox]` is something all users know
for a long time. Those were the first „tick” fields we saw, probably somewhere
in Windows settings panel. They were there, when first web pages that allowed
actually doing something other than reading, hit the ‚net. And now they are
here, and please, make them stay.
