Last time we’ve successfully scaffolded the project. Now let’s get it up by
creating a component library using the Atomic Design methodology.

Let’s start with a bit of theory. Atomic Design is a methodology that
prioritizes creating small components that can be, later on, used to build
larger pieces, which then can be used to build ever larger ones. It has three
most important elements: atoms, molecules and organisms.

- **atoms** are the smallest elements. Think single elements like an icon, input
  field or a text.
- **molecules** are larger, and consists of atoms. A good example is a component
  that has input field with label bound.
- **organisms** represent the largest blocks that you would build using
  molecules and atoms. Think an article excerpt or login form.

There are also **views**, which represent, well, the entire view for a screen,
but for now, let’s not dive there.

## Prerequisites

I will be continuing from the
[Part 0](https://buszewski.com/writings/2024-08-13-design-systems-in-react-scaffolding-and-setup-part-0/),
so please clone the `main` branch. For cleanliness’ sake, I’ll create a new
branch.

I will use a lot of things that were mentioned in the previous article,
including components generators and Storybook, so please familiarize yourself
with it before going forward.

## What we’re building today?

I made a simple login form that needs coding. Kinda like a homework you’d get
during a job interview. It looks like this:

<figure></figure>

There is also an
[online version in Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/s/8aa2b94a-e1dc-4116-a063-f3786e71b4a4),
where you can inspect it if needed.

If you look at it, seems simple, right? Because it is. Let’s try to analyze it:

- the main thing that you see are the input fields, that’s one component;
- there are buttons, looks different, so one component with variants;
- there’s text for label, so another component;
- there is a background that drops shadow, so another component for wrapper.

This gives us four components, but to utilize Atomic Design, we will make four
_atoms_.

The creation itself will be a bit of a throwback to my piece about
[TDD in React](https://buszewski.com/writings/2024-08-28-test-driven-development-in-react/),
as in there I also did a login form. I like login forms, what can I say. The
difference is, I won’t be writing tests to save time, but I will write CSS and
use Storybook!

## Expanding the generator

Last time our generator made everything into one large directory named `ui`.
What we want is more granularity. Luckily, in my React Starter I have this
preconfigured already, so I’ll just yoink it in here.

`plop-templates/Component.tsx.hbs`:

```hbs
import type { HTMLAttributes } from "react";

interface Props extends HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {}

export default function {{pascalCase name}}(props: Props) {
  return (
  <div {...props} />
  );
}
```

`plop-templates/Story.tsx.hbs`:

```hbs
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/react";

import {{pascalCase name}} from "./{{pascalCase name}}";

export const Primary: StoryObj<typeof {{pascalCase name}}> = {
  args: {
  children: "Hello from Storybook",
  },
  };

export default {
  title: "UI/{{pascalCase type}}s/{{pascalCase name}}",
  component: {{pascalCase name}},
} as Meta<typeof {{pascalCase name}}>
```

And `plopfile.mjs`:

```js
export default function plop(/** @type {import("plop").NodePlopAPI} */ plop) {
  plop.setGenerator("ui", {
    description: "Create a new UI component",
    prompts: [
      {
        type: "list",
        name: "type",
        message: "Component type",
        choices: ["atom", "molecule", "organism", "view"],
      },
      {
        type: "input",
        name: "name",
        message: "Component name",
      },
    ],

    actions: [
      {
        type: "add",
        path: "./src/ui/{{type}}s/{{pascalCase name}}/{{pascalCase name}}.tsx",
        templateFile: "./plop-templates/Component.tsx.hbs",
      },
      {
        type: "add",
        path: "./src/ui/{{type}}s/{{pascalCase name}}/{{pascalCase name}}.stories.tsx",
        templateFile: "./plop-templates/Story.tsx.hbs",
      },
      {
        type: "append",
        path: "./src/ui/{{type}}s/index.tsx",
        template:
          'export { default as {{pascalCase name}} } from "./{{pascalCase name}}/{{pascalCase name}}";',
      },
    ],
  });
}
```

I am not diving into Plop, as I’ve done this before.

Alright, so now we can start making components!

## First, the tokens

Before going for components, we need to get our tokens ready. Tokens are like
variables, you define them and use it instead of hardcoding values. For example,
you define colors and spacing and then write `color: --var(dark);` rather than
`color: #333;`.

Since we’re using Tailwind, let’s extend the config.

Tokens for this particular example can be taken from the Sketch file I’ve linked
before.

`tailwind.config.mjs`:

```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    fontSize: {
      base: "12px",
    },
    spacing: {
      small: "4px",
      medium: "8px",
      large: "16px",
    },
    colors: {
      grey: {
        dark: "#454545",
        minor: "#8B9CA0",
        light: "#ccc",
      },
      blue: {
        light: "#A7DBD8",
        dark: "#062E4C",
      },
      bg: "#fff",
    },
    boxShadow: {
      card: "0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)",
    },
  },
},
```

## Starting with the atoms

Let’s start with the simplest one, so label. It should be a variant of a larger
atom, text. Simple enough.

To start the generator, we must go into the console and type

```bash
~ npm run plop
```

It will ask some questions: type – “atom” and name should be “text”.

I did this atom before in another video, but for the sake of clarity, let’s go
through it one more time.

```tsx
import type {
  ComponentPropsWithoutRef,
  ElementType,
  HTMLAttributes,
  JSX,
} from "react";

interface Props<T extends ElementType>
  extends HTMLAttributes<JSX.IntrinsicElements> {
  as?: T;
  bold?: boolean;
  italic?: boolean;
  color?: string;
}

type ReturnProps<P extends ElementType> = Props<P> &
  Omit<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<P>, keyof Props<P>>;

export default function Text<T extends ElementType = "p">({
  bold,
  italic,
  className,
  as,
  ...rest
}: ReturnProps<T>) {
  const classNames = [className, "text-base"];
  let Tag: ElementType = "p";

  if (as) {
    Tag = as;
  }

  if (bold) {
    classNames.push("font-bold");
  }

  if (italic) {
    classNames.push("italic");
  }

  if (rest.color) {
    classNames.push(`text-${rest.color}`);
  }

  return <Tag className={classNames.join(" ")} {...rest} />;
}
```

The most complex part here are the types. What we're doing here is taking a
generic (L8) and making sure it’s a HTML element, like `p` or `div`. That way,
we’ll get proper typings, so for example, if we’ll use `label`, we will get
`htmlFor` prop properly typed. Rest is rather simple, with class names being
injected if bolding or italics are required.

Let’s go to the story now. There’s, frankly, not much to do there, since we’ve
generated the basic one. You could expand this to showcase various colors and
stuff, but it has controls, so there’s not really a point. And since it’s a
basic text, we won’t even style it for now.

Okay, it wasn’t as simple as I hoped, but still nothing mind-breaking. Let’s do
input now. First, the generator:

```bash
npm run plop;
```

Then we select “atom” and name it “input”. Our generated code is for the div, so
let’s adjust it slightly:

```tsx
// ./src/ui/atoms/Input/Input.tsx

import type { HTMLProps } from "react";

type Props = HTMLProps<HTMLInputElement>;

export default function Input(props: Props) {
  return <input {...props} />;
}
```

I’ve changed the `HTMLAttributes` to `HTMLProps`, since it’s wider and offers
more. Not always a necessity, but for inputs it’s required.

For story, let’s change `children` to `placeholder`:

```tsx
// ./src/ui/atoms/Input/Input.stories.tsx

import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/react";

import Input from "./Input";

export const Primary: StoryObj<typeof Input> = {
  args: {
    placeholder: "Hello there",
  },
};

export default {
  title: "UI/Atoms/Input",
  component: Input,
} as Meta<typeof Input>;
```

Seems simple enough. Alright, let’s fire the Storybook and do the styling.
Since, again, we’re using Tailwind, this is just a collection of class names:

```tsx
import type { HTMLProps } from "react";

type Props = HTMLProps<HTMLInputElement>;

export default function Input({ className, ...props }: Props) {
  const classNames = [
    className,
    "text-base",
    "text-grey-dark",
    "border",
    "border-1",
    "border-grey-light",
    "rounded",
    "lh-form-element",
    "h-form-element",
    "px-large",
  ];

  return <input className={classNames.join(" ")} {...props} />;
}
```

One thing to add to the config is the height, which will be used for both input
and buttons:

```js
// ./tailwind.config.js

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      height: {
        "form-element": "38px",
      },
      ...
```

And we have the input. That was pretty fast, actually!

So since we’re so warmed up, button shouldn’t be a problem as well. Again, run
the generator and pick “atom” and name it “button”.

Apart from using a `variant` switch and changing the type, this is all smooth
sailing:

```tsx
// ./src/ui/atoms/Button/Button.tsx

import type { ButtonHTMLAttributes } from "react";

interface Props extends ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  variant?: "regular" | "error" | "secondary";
}

export default function Button({
  className,
  variant = "regular",
  ...props
}: Props) {
  const classNames = [
    className,
    "rounded",
    "h-form-element",
    "lh-form-element",
    "px-large",
    "text-base",
  ];

  switch (variant) {
    case "error":
      classNames.push("text-red-dark", "bg-red-light", "font-bold");
      break;

    case "empty":
      classNames.push("text-grey-minor", "bg-transparent", "p-0");
      break;

    default:
    case "regular":
      classNames.push("text-blue-dark", "bg-blue-light", "font-bold");
      break;
  }

  return <button className={classNames.join(" ")} {...props} />;
}
```

The story can basically remain unchanged, there’s nothing to add there.

Last, but not least, we want the container with shadow. Run the generator, pick
“atom” and call it “box wrapper”. It comes as a `div` and, while we could
enhance it to accept other types, like `Text`, I don’t feel we need this now.
You can always expand on this later on!

```tsx
// ./src/ui/atoms/BoxWrapper/BoxWrapper.tsx

import type { HTMLAttributes } from "react";

type Props = HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>;

export default function BoxWrapper({ className, ...props }: Props) {
  const classNames = [className, "rounded", "bg-bg", "p-large", "shadow-card"];

  return <div className={classNames.join(" ")} {...props} />;
}
```

I am not adding any font styles or anything like this, because this is just a
container. Its children will control it.

Seems like we’re done with atoms. Let’s use them to create a molecule!

## Making a molecule

It is a smaller project, so we will only have one molecule: input with label.
Let’s get to it! In the `plop` generator, this time select “molecule” and call
it “input with label”.

In here, we will use the famous “composition”, so we will import stuff from
atoms and create the molecule.

```tsx
// ./src/ui/molecules/InputWithLabel/InputWithLabel.tsx

import type { HTMLProps } from "react";

import { Input, Text } from "../../atoms";

interface Props extends HTMLProps<HTMLInputElement> {
  label: string;
}

export default function InputWithLabel({ label, ...props }: Props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Text as="label" htmlFor={props.id}>
        {label}
      </Text>
      <Input {...props} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

I am putting all the props in `input`, since this is the “meat” of the molecule,
label’s just there as an addon. For story, we just need to replace `children`:

```tsx
// ./src/ui/molecules/InputWithLabel/InputWithLabel.stories.tsx

import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/react";

import InputWithLabel from "./InputWithLabel";

export const Primary: StoryObj<typeof InputWithLabel> = {
  args: {
    label: "Hello from Storybook",
    id: "hello",
    placeholder: "Hello there",
  },
};

export default {
  title: "UI/Molecules/InputWithLabel",
  component: InputWithLabel,
} as Meta<typeof InputWithLabel>;
```

And now we have to add some styling, since this doesn’t look right. This will
only take styling the main `div`, as the rest is already taken care of.

```tsx
// ./src/ui/molecules/InputWithLabel/InputWithLabel.tsx

export default function InputWithLabel({ label, ...props }: Props) {
  return (
    <div className="grid gap-small mb-medium">
    ...
```

Alright, we have the molecule, let’s build the final organism!

## The “form” organism

This won’t differ much from making a molecule, it’s still mostly composition.
The difference is, as mentioned, organism should be rather self-contained and
able to live on its own.

In the generator, pick “organism” and call it “login box”. And, as mentioned,
this is mostly composition, so:

```tsx
// ./src/ui/organisms/LoginBox/LoginBox.tsx

import type { HTMLAttributes } from "react";
import { BoxWrapper, Button } from "../../atoms";
import { InputWithLabel } from "../../molecules";

interface Props extends HTMLAttributes<HTMLFormElement> {
  onForgotPasswordClick?: () => void;
}

export default function LoginBox({ onForgotPasswordClick, ...props }: Props) {
  return (
    <form {...props}>
      <BoxWrapper>
        <InputWithLabel
          label="Your email"
          id="email"
          placeholder="myname@email.com"
        />
        <InputWithLabel
          label="Your password"
          id="password"
          placeholder="••••••••"
          type="password"
        />
        <div className="flex justify-between">
          <Button variant="empty" type="button" onClick={onForgotPasswordClick}>
            Forgot password?
          </Button>
          <Button variant="regular" type="submit">
            Sign in
          </Button>
        </div>
      </BoxWrapper>
    </form>
  );
}
```

We will have more fun with the story! I mean, maybe not _that much_, but still!
Since this is an interactive component that emits an event on submitting, we
should be able to click around, right? So let’s add a handler:

```tsx
// ./src/ui/organisms/LoginBox/LoginBox.stories.tsx

import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/react";
import { action } from "@storybook/addon-actions";

import LoginBox from "./LoginBox";
import { FormEvent } from "react";

export const Primary: StoryObj<typeof LoginBox> = {
  args: {
    onSubmit: (e: FormEvent) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      action("onSubmit")(e);
    },
  },
};

export default {
  title: "UI/Organisms/LoginBox",
  component: LoginBox,
  parameters: { actions: { argTypesRegex: "^on.*" } },
} as Meta<typeof LoginBox>;
```

In L10, we’re adding argument `onSubmit`, that’ll capture the event, preventing
it from doing what a form does (so, redirecting), and then we will log our
action using the `action` handler from Storybook’s addon. Lastly, we are placing
a catch-all in the L21, that will take all the non-caught events starting with
“on” (so, for example, `onForgotPasswordClick`) and log it as well.

–

That’s it. It may seem a bit too complex, but this methodology really shines
when there’s more elements. Eventually you arrive at the place where all your
work consists of composition, and isn’t it what React is all about? At least it
was 10 years ago.
