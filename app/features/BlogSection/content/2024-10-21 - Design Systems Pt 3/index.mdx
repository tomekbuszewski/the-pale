Last time we’ve used atomic design methodology to move the whole UI to a
separate layer. Today we will take business problems and put it in yet another
place.

Managing business logic in a multi-page application can be solved in many ways.
These ways, more or less, assume separation of layers, such as UI, models,
communication etc. Feature-driven goes a step further: it utilizes all the
layers underneath, but also creates one by itself, and keeps the
business-related stuff in there.

## Definition of a feature

Before we start hacking away, let’s stop for a minute and discuss what is a
feature? One person will say “a newsletter pane allowing users to subscribe”,
the other – “a whole registration flow.” Funny enough, both will be right.
**Feature is a set of actions that user can perform in order to achieve their
goal**. If my goal is to subscribe to a newsletter, a complete feature will have
an input allowing me to enter my email and a button to submit it, followed by
status report (signed successfully or otherwise). If my goal is to create an
account on a website, the feature I want is a form that will collect my data and
inform me of the process.

## Feature architecture

Description I gave just seconds before is very abstract. What is a “set of
actions”? Well, that depends on what we want to do. Not all features are equal,
some will require just a simple UI and not even a backend connection (this
light/dark theme toggle), some will have its own routing and a separate domain
in the API.

The gist is, a feature is complete if it has all it needs to properly function
in one place. Of course this doesn’t mean that we can’t use other layers, like
UI or hooks, but we must remember not to modify these. A feature shouldn’t
modify other layers, only read and utilize them. So, if my feature calls for a
different input that is in the UI, I have two options:

- create a new variant of the base component;
- create a new component only bound to the said feature.

Even if the first option might seem like the obvious choice, it’s not always
that simple. But this is, frankly, more of a design problem. The design system
should be well-defined by the designers, and introduction of new components
should happen in a structured way, not on the back of a feature. But I digress.

## What are we building?

I’ve mentioned two features earlier – smaller, the newsletter box, and larger,
the sign-up page. Today we will build both, as they will require different
approaches and will pose different challenges.

We won’t be building backend for neither of the features. All communications
will be mocked using promises, so it will look and work properly on the client
side.

### Newsletter box

Newsletter is the small feature, it looks like this:

<figure></figure>

It has two states: idle and success. It can also have an error state, but for
the sake of time I omit that one.

### Sign up

Signing up is more complex. We have a form that will redirect us to another page
upon success. It looks like this:

<figure></figure>

It has two screens, one with the form and one with the status feedback. As with
the newsletter, we’ll only do success page to save time.

## Preparations

As always in this series, I am taking our Design System repo and create a new
branch. Now, let’s discuss how the file structure should look.

Our main field of action will be `src/features` directory. In there we will
house all the features we will work on. Their structure will slightly differ,
depending on what each one needs, but in general, there will be

- a main file;
- tests (if applicable);
- hooks (if applicable);
- types (if applicable);
- css module (if applicable);
- story (if applicable).

What will bind these with the main app is a common export. It’s important to
treat all features equal, so that usage won’t be on per-case basis. It will
expose

- routing (if applicable), or
- the main component (if applicable)

That’s about it. There’s no need to export anything else, as our application
won’t rely on it. But, if we would use something like Remix, which doesn’t have
support for server components, we would also have to expose loader to integrate
it with the main route.

### Adding React Router

I will throw in React Router

```bash
npm i react-router-dom
```

And configure the main routes:

```tsx
// ./src/main.tsx

import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";

import App from "./App.tsx";
import "./style.css";

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <App />,
  },
  {
    path: "/sign-up",
    element: <div>Sign up</div>,
  },
]);

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

As you can see, there’s nothing fancy just yet. But, to start with the right
foot, let’s export the router to a separate file, alongside the routing
configuration.

```tsx
// ./src/routing.tsx

import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App.tsx";

export const ROUTES = {
  HOME: "/",
  SIGN_UP: "/sign-up",
};

export const router = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: ROUTES.HOME, element: <App /> },
  {
    path: ROUTES.SIGN_UP,
    element: <div>Sign up</div>,
  },
]);
```

This way we will have a _centralized_ way to control the entire routing, and on
top of that, we will have `ROUTES` config to always have proper navigation.

### The fake backend

As mentioned earlier, we won’t communicate with any backend for this. But this
doesn’t mean, we can have a client that will pretend to be a server, right?

I will create a simple `sleep` function that will simulate the waiting period,
and a function that, after “sleeping”, will return a JSON payload:

```ts
// ./src/api/index.ts

async function sleep(ms = 100) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

export async function postNewsletterEmail({ email }: { email: string }) {
  await sleep();
  return { success: true, email };
}
```

That’s basically it. Clients generated from the OpenAPI schema are very similar.

### Adding the UI

As you saw, there’s a few new components we need to add. Luckily, I was lazy
doing these, so they are easy to implement. First, we have the title and then,
the notification. We can use Plop to make it faster

```bash
npm run plop;
```

Pick “molecule” and name it “box header”.

```tsx
// ./src/ui/molecules/BoxHeader/BoxHeader.tsx

interface Props {
  className?: string;
  children: string;
}

import { Text } from "../../atoms";

export default function BoxHeader({ className, ...props }: Props) {
  const classNames = [
    "text-lg",
    "text-blue-dark",
    "border-b",
    "font-bold",
    "pb-1",
    className,
  ];

  return <Text {...props} as="h3" className={classNames.join(" ")} />;
}
```

and do the same with “notification”:

```tsx
// ./src/molecules/Notification/Notification.tsx

import type { HTMLAttributes } from "react";

interface Props extends HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {
  variant?: "success" | "error";
}

export default function Notification({ variant, className, ...props }: Props) {
  const classNames = [className, "rounded", "p-2"];

  switch (variant) {
    case "error":
      classNames.push("bg-grey-light", "text-grey-dark");
      break;
    default:
    case "success":
      classNames.push("bg-green-light", "text-green-dark");
      break;
  }

  return <div {...props} className={classNames.join(" ")} />;
}
```

## The Newsletter feature

Alright, I think we got everything. So, the first thing is to create
`./features/Newsletter/Newsletter.tsx` file. Inside, we’ll just define our
component like it’s nothing fancy:

```tsx
// ./src/features/Newsletter/Newsletter.tsx

import { BoxWrapper, Button, Text } from "../../ui/atoms";
import { InputWithLabel, BoxHeader, Notification } from "../../ui/molecules";

import { postNewsletterEmail } from "../../api";
import { ChangeEvent, FormEvent, useRef, useState } from "react";

const useNewsletter = () => {
  const email = useRef<string>();
  const [status, setStatus] = useState<
    "idle" | "loading" | "success" | "error"
  >("idle");

  function handleChange(event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    email.current = event.target.value;
  }

  function handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();

    if (!email.current) {
      return;
    }

    setStatus("loading");

    postNewsletterEmail({ email: email.current }).then(() => {
      setStatus("success");
    });
  }

  return { handleChange, handleSubmit, status };
};

const Newsletter = () => {
  const { handleChange, handleSubmit, status } = useNewsletter();

  return (
    <BoxWrapper>
      {status === "success" ? (
        <Notification>You successfully signed up! Thanks!</Notification>
      ) : (
        <form
          onSubmit={handleSubmit}
          className={
            status === "loading" ? "opacity-50 pointer-events-none" : ""
          }
        >
          <BoxHeader className="mb-1">Newsletter</BoxHeader>
          <Text color="grey-minor" className="mb-1">
            Sign in to our newsletter to receive updates on our products!
          </Text>

          <InputWithLabel
            id="email"
            name="email"
            label="Your email"
            placeholder="johndoe@company.com"
            required
            type="email"
            onChange={handleChange}
            className="mb-1"
          />

          <div className="flex justify-end">
            <Button variant="regular" type="submit">
              Sign me up!
            </Button>
          </div>
        </form>
      )}
    </BoxWrapper>
  );
};

export default Newsletter;
```

As you see, I’ve put the logic in the hook. We could move it to
`Newsletter.hooks.ts`, but for one hook, there’s no need.

## Feature export definition

So now, the most interesting thing. As mentioned, we need to define our export
for all the features.

Let’s start by defining the feature that only has a component:

```ts
// ./src/features/index.ts
import { ComponentType } from "react";

interface FeatureWithComponent<Type = unknown> {
  component: ComponentType<Type>;
}
```

And now we can assign this to our feature:

```ts
// ./src/features/index.ts

export const Newsletter: FeatureWithComponent = {
  component: NewsletterFeature,
};
```

…and that’s it. Let’s use it.

```tsx
// ./src/App.tsx

import { useState } from "react";
import reactLogo from "./assets/react.svg";
import viteLogo from "/vite.svg";
import "./App.css";

import { Newsletter } from "./features";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <a href="https://vitejs.dev" target="_blank">
          <img src={viteLogo} className="logo" alt="Vite logo" />
        </a>
        <a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank">
          <img src={reactLogo} className="logo react" alt="React logo" />
        </a>
      </div>

      <main className="grid md:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr] gap-4 md:gap-2 items-start">
        <div>
          <h1>Vite + React</h1>
          <div className="card">
            <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>
              count is {count}
            </button>
            <p>
              Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to test HMR
            </p>
          </div>
          <p className="read-the-docs mb-5">
            Click on the Vite and React logos to learn more
          </p>
        </div>
        <Newsletter.component />
      </main>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

I know it’s not pretty, but that’s not the point. The point is, our feature is
done!

## The Signup feature

Okay, so now the big guns. The signup feature will require, albeit simple,
routing. This means, the main export won’t be a component, but an array or
routes. Apart from this, development will be rather simple. But, let’s start
from the top.

First, I am creating a new function to be our api.

```ts
export async function postUserSignup({
  username,
  password,
  email,
}: {
  username: string;
  password: string;
  email: string;
}) {
  await sleep();
  return { success: Boolean(password), username, email };
}
```

Now, let’s create our first _screen_. Thanks to atomic design, this is really
just LEGO. Yes, I do realize I am just an atomic design stan at this point.

```tsx
// ./src/features/SignUp/screens/SignUp.tsx

import { Button, Text, BoxWrapper } from "../../../ui/atoms";
import { BoxHeader, InputWithLabel } from "../../../ui/molecules";
import { FormEvent, useRef } from "react";

import { postUserSignup } from "../../../api";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { SIGN_UP_ROUTES } from "../routing.ts";

const useSignUp = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const formData = useRef<{
    email?: string;
    password?: string;
    username?: string;
  }>({});

  const handleSubmit = (event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    if (
      formData.current.email &&
      formData.current.password &&
      formData.current.username
    ) {
      postUserSignup({
        email: formData.current.email,
        password: formData.current.password,
        username: formData.current.username,
      }).then(() => {
        navigate(SIGN_UP_ROUTES.SUCCESS);
      });
    }
  };

  const handleChange = (event: FormEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    formData.current = {
      ...formData.current,
      [event.currentTarget.name]: event.currentTarget.value,
    };
  };

  return { handleChange, handleSubmit };
};

export default function SignUp() {
  const { handleChange, handleSubmit } = useSignUp();

  return (
    <BoxWrapper>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <BoxHeader className="mb-1">Sign Up</BoxHeader>

        <InputWithLabel
          id="username"
          name="username"
          label="Username"
          placeholder="johndoe"
          required
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        <InputWithLabel
          id="email"
          name="email"
          label="Email"
          type="email"
          placeholder="johndoe@company.com"
          required
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        <InputWithLabel
          id="password"
          name="password"
          label="Password"
          type="password"
          placeholder="••••••••"
          required
          onChange={handleChange}
        />

        <Text color="grey-minor" className="my-1">
          Create an account to access our products!
        </Text>

        <div className="flex justify-end">
          <Button variant="regular" type="submit">
            Sign up
          </Button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </BoxWrapper>
  );
}
```

and let’s slap the Success page:

```tsx
// ./src/features/SignUp/screens/Success.tsx

import { BoxWrapper, Button } from "../../../ui/atoms";
import { Notification } from "../../../ui/molecules";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

export default function Success() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <BoxWrapper>
      <Notification>
        Congratulations! Your registration is complete. You can now log in.
      </Notification>
      <Button onClick={() => navigate("/")}>Go to login</Button>
    </BoxWrapper>
  );
}
```

As you see, in both screens we have the same wrapper. We can mitigate this by
creating a wrapper! So let’s remove the `BoxWrapper` from both screens and
proceed to `SignUp/SignUp.tsx`. In here, we will create not only the routing,
but also the wrapper.

```tsx
// ./src/features/SignUp/SignUp.tsx

import { Outlet, RouteObject } from "react-router-dom";
import { SIGN_UP_ROUTES } from "./routing.ts";
import { BoxWrapper } from "../../ui/atoms";

import SignUpScreen from "./screens/SignUp.tsx";
import Success from "./screens/Success.tsx";

export const Wrapper = () => (
  <BoxWrapper className="m-auto max-w-[300px] mt-5">
    <Outlet />
  </BoxWrapper>
);

export default [
  {
    path: SIGN_UP_ROUTES.SIGN_UP,
    element: <SignUpScreen />,
  },
  {
    path: SIGN_UP_ROUTES.SUCCESS,
    element: <Success />,
  },
] as RouteObject[];
```

And with this, let’s go to `./features/index.ts` to add the exports:

```tsx
// ./src/features/index.ts

import { ComponentType } from "react";

import NewsletterFeature from "./Newsletter/Newsletter";
import SignUpFeature, { Wrapper as SignUpWrapper } from "./SignUp/SignUp";
import { RouteObject } from "react-router-dom";

interface FeatureWithComponent<Type = unknown> {
  component: ComponentType<Type>;
}

interface FeatureWithRouting {
  routing: RouteObject[];
}

type FeatureWithRoutingAndWrapper<T = unknown> = FeatureWithRouting &
  FeatureWithComponent<T>;

export const Newsletter: FeatureWithComponent = {
  component: NewsletterFeature,
};

export const SignUp: FeatureWithRoutingAndWrapper = {
  routing: SignUpFeature,
  component: SignUpWrapper,
};
```

As you can see, we’ve added a new interface – `FeatureWithRouting` and a new
type – `FeatureWithRoutingAndWrapper`. This way we can export everything like
before:

```tsx
// ./src/routing.tsx

import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App.tsx";

import { SignUp } from "./features";

export const ROUTES = {
  HOME: "/",
  SIGN_UP: "/sign-up",
};

export const router = createBrowserRouter([
  { path: ROUTES.HOME, element: <App /> },
  {
    path: ROUTES.SIGN_UP,
    element: <SignUp.component />,
    children: SignUp.routing,
  },
]);
```

And now, the only thing left is to modify the main page to link everything
together:

```tsx
// ./src/App.tsx

import { LoginBox } from "./ui/organisms";

import { Newsletter } from "./features";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { Button, Text } from "./ui/atoms";
import { ROUTES } from "./routing.tsx";

function App() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <main className="grid md:grid-cols-[1fr_1fr] gap-4 md:gap-2 items-start m-3 md:m-10">
      <div>
        <LoginBox onForgotPasswordClick={() => navigate("/404")} />
        <Text color="muted" className="text-center my-5">
          - or -
        </Text>
        <div className="flex justify-center">
          <Button onClick={() => navigate(ROUTES.SIGN_UP)}>
            Create an account
          </Button>
        </div>
      </div>
      <Newsletter.component />
    </main>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Nothing fancy here, logging in doesn’t even work, but hey, we got our features!

—

Feature-based development is a very handy technique to encapsulate everything
that is business-related and to keep it in one spot. Definitely beats scattering
it across ten different directories, doesn’t it?

Thank you for reading and happy coding your features!
