          "Nintendo Switch is a special thing. Its hardware is basically Wii U, which was too little even then it launched, but the games. Oh, the games. Mario Kart 8 is enough to recommend the entire thing, with Metroid Dread, the two Zeldas and other Mario titles to boot.",
          "PC with RTX 3080Ti and Ryzen 7 is my main gaming platform as of recent. I was against gaming on PC for years, mostly due to \"I work with computers, so I don't want them on my free time\", but the games not available on consoles are just too much to ignore. From indies, to oldies (I actually bought the rig to play classic Fallout games), to titles better adjusted for mouse (shooters, RPGs, aRPGs). Fun fact: the first game I launched on my new computer was Quake II, which I wanted to play for over 15 years.",
          "Beelink SER5 is a tiny computer I use as an emulation and media station. My old LG OLED TV doesn't work well with streaming apps, some (like Canal+) don't have dedicated apps at all, so using this is a perfect solution. Plus, since I don't have my PS1 with me, I can still play the games (and some PS2 titles as well, but not as many)."
